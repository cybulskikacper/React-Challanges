    /* Challenge

    The JSX of the houseCards being generated by the map method below needs to be put in a separate functional component. Your task is to do so as follows:




    	3. The variables in the JSX should become props, which will need to be passed into the
           <HouseCard /> you will be returning in the map method.


        5. You should only pass up to a maximum of four props being into <HouseCard />. You
           *should not* manually pass every piece of houseData as a seperate prop! The site should look and behave exactly the same once you've completed these tasks. The challenge here is just about improving the code "underneath the hood"!
