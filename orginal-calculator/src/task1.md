The numFromClick value should be added to the end of the currentNum array of currentCalc,
preserving any values that are already saved in the array.

      a. The numFromClick value should be added to the currentNum array of currentCalc. Any
         previous values in the array should *not* be preserved â€” the numFromClick      value should become the *only* value in the array.

      b. All of the other properties of currentCalc should be reverted to their initial values,
         which are saved in INITIAL_STATE (line 9 above).
